Song Stats is a web app where you can summarize and compare the Statistical Song data over the years in a
visual manner using our dynamic charts. We use the data from
the [Spotify Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lehaknarnauli/spotify-datasets)
on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and created the plots based
on yearly data for tracks (songs) from 1922 to 2021. Some of the metrics summarized and compared are
Acousticness, Danceability, Energy, Instrumentalness, Liveness, Speechiness, Valence. We also visualize
Loudness, Tempo, Duration and comparison of Time Signatures and Keys.
